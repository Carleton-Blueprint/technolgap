  <AboutUs
    title="About Us"
    body1="Technolgap traces its roots back to Carleton University in February 2020, where it originated as a student community for women in tech in Ottawa. Co-founders Alexa Liaskovski and Gina Bak, inspired by their experience at the Grace Hopper Celebration in 2019, noticed a glaring disparity in the availability of information about tech opportunities. Despite the abundance of opportunities in the field, they realized they hadn't heard about many of them. To address this gap, Technolgap was founded as a platform for students to share relevant opportunities with each other, including hackathons, job postings, scholarships, and workshops."
    body2="As the community grew, it became evident that women in tech, particularly in Canada, faced unique challenges in starting their careers. To meet these challenges head-on, Technolgap expanded its reach across Canada and began offering mentorship programs and workshops tailored to the specific needs of its members."
    body3="Today, Technolgap boasts a community of over 500 members and continues to evolve. However, in 2022, the community went dormant. It remained inactive until 2024 when one of its former members, Anjali Patel, took the reins. Initially joining Technolgap as an Events Organizer in 2021, Anjali along with her enthusiastic team, is now on a mission to revitalize the community, rebranding it, and rebuilding it into a thriving platform once again!"
